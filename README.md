# birbDot

 - Super simple
 - Basically none of my own work
 - Still not managed to achieve what I wanted?

 ***

- R3F scene with a glsl postprocessing pass 
 - [Sobel Filter borrowed from](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/jsm/shaders/SobelOperatorShader.js)
 - But it wants you to start from grayscale
 - Unlikely to have achieved that because I am refusing to do it in a seperate postprocessing pass.
 - 0 clue how to mess with the sampler2D without converting it and then I cant put it back. 
 - Walked myself into a genuine coding problem and the stream has started as I type this.
